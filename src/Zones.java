     * of the zone graph: every slide between two zones goes from a smaller number to a larger number.
     *
     * Plan: 1) DFS on the slides, write the cells in the order in which they are finished (use a stack, not recursion);
     * 2) go through the cells from the last finished to the first; if a cell has no zone yet, DFS from it on the reversed
     * slides (slidesInto) and give every cell it reaches the next zone number.
     * Is DAG in Main is 1 when the number of zones equals the number of cells (no cycle), so you do not need a separate check.
