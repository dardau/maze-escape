 * Mission 3. Escape: DFS from cell 0 to the last cell (rows * cols - 1) in the maze of Mission 1.
 * Two neighbouring cells are connected when the wall between them is broken.
 * The neighbours are tried in this order: up, right, down, left (cell - cols, cell + 1, cell + cols, cell - 1).
 * The ready method Graphs.open(w, broken) gives you the open neighbours of every cell, in no particular order:
 * to visit them in the required order, go through the four cells above one by one and take those that are in the list.
 * The program must not overflow the stack on a maze of 1000 by 1000 cells.
